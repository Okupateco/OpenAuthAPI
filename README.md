# OpenAuthAPI

## To-Do:
- Make the db module more efficient through fetching headers and using dicts for inserting
- Extend account.py to add fields from config file
- Extend api.py to include:
  - changePassword()
  - changeEmail()
  - changeField()
  - setProfilePic()

## Future
> For this repository I wanna keep it to just the account/authorization stuff alone, however in the future I do plan on starting a fork of this project to produce a fully featured site.
